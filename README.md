This repository contains SQL queries and optimization techniques applied on an e-commerce dataset including `customers`, `orders`, `order_items`, and `products`.

## âœ… Objectives Covered

### a. SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY
- Retrieved specific columns with filters.

- **INNER JOIN** used for combining related rows across tables.
- **LEFT JOIN** included all customers even without orders.
- **RIGHT JOIN** captured all orders even if a customer record is missing.

### c. Subqueries
- Used to compute dynamic values like `AVG(price)` and total spending per customer using nested queries.

### d. Aggregate Functions
- `SUM()`, `AVG()` used to analyze sales and customer spending.

### e. Views for Analysis
- Created reusable SQL views like `customer_spending` for quick access to calculated insights.
